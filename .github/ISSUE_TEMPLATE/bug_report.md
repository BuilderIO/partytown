                      THIS ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED
             (unless there is a high quality reproduction)


We can only help you if you provide us a good reproduction of the problem! 
We are verry sorry but a stack trace or "it does not work" simply does not 
have enough usefull information for us to help you.

Unless we can reproduce the issue in under 1 minute it will be closed as 
can't reproduce!

Your reproduction must have these:
1. an easy way to reproduce the failure on our computers
  - github repo for us to clone OR
  - fork https://replit.com/@MiskoHevery/Partytown-Example
2. exact steps on what to do to cause an error
3. exact steps to retrieve the failure

- [ ] I am interested in helping provide a fix!
