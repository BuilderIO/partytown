Partytown is built with the goal that any third-party script can be ran from within it. At the lowest level, any script can add the `type="text/partytown"` attribute to have it executed from a web worker.

Below is a list of plugins / libraries that are tested & known to be working with Partytown with their commonly used [forward configs](/forwarding-events) and [proxied domains](/proxying-requests).
