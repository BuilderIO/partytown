Partytown can work with any HTML page, and doesn't require a specific framework. However, to make it easier to use in various frameworks or services, plugins/wrappers can be made for their ecosystem. Below is a current list of integrations. Please help us add more!

- [Angular](/angular)
- [Astro](/astro)
- [Gatsby](/gatsby)
- [HTML](/html)
- [NextJS](/nextjs)
- [Nuxt](/nuxt)
- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/integrations/partytown/)
- [React](/react)
- [Remix](/remix)
- [Shopify Hydrogen](/shopify-hydrogen)
- [SvelteKit](/sveltekit)

See something missing and would like to contribute? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/issues/new/choose) and we'd love to work with you to get your integration up and running and listed here. It may be as simple as just writing a doc, similar to the ones above, detailing how to best implement Partytown in the framework or service.
