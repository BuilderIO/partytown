## Can all scripts use Partytown?

Not necessarily. While Partytown covers many cases that allow it to work great in many cases, there are also scenarios where your script may hit an internal error and silently fail. We encourage you to thoroughly test when running any scripts first in a development environment, and then in production. Please also see the [Trade-Offs](/trade-offs) docs.

## How do I know when a script is not working with Partytown?

Test test test! There are endless scenarios in which a script could have been written, and the tricks they could be doing. While Partytown has worked to [test](/tests/) many of these scenarios, there's a good chance a certain example isn't being accounted for. We encourage you to thoroughly test when running any scripts first in a development environment, and then in production.

## What do I do if my script is not working with Partytown?

Please first search through the [Github issues](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/issues) for a similar issue. If a similar issue exists, please add a comment with as much additional information as possible.

If a similar [issue](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/issues) does not already exist, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/issues/new/choose) that includes:

- Minimal Reproduction Case: If maintainers and contributors are unable to reproduce the same error, then it makes it very difficult to debug and fix. Any issued opened without a minimal reproduction example will be closed.
- E2E Test: A good example of an End-to-end test is one where the test fails before the fix, and passes after the fix. But also, all the other tests pass too. Please see [Submitting Issues And Writing Tests](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/DEVELOPER.md#submitting-issues-and-writing-tests) for more details.

## Why do some scripts work, and others don't with Partytown?

Most of yesterday's and today's third-party scripts were built from the ground-up to work only on the main UI thread, rather than from a web worker which does not have access to the DOM or window. Partytown does its best to. Please also see the [Trade-Offs](/trade-offs) docs.

## Will you debug why my script is not working for me?

Unfortunately, the project contributors and maintainers don’t have the capacity to debug every single third-party script on external websites. As an Open-Source project, Partytown's goal is to help encourage the community to assist one another. Helping to improvement the project can come in many forms:

- [Opening issues](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/DEVELOPER.md#submitting-issues-and-writing-tests) with minimal reproduction cases
- Creating fixes with [Pull Requests](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/DEVELOPER.md#submitting-issues-and-writing-tests)
- Adding [End-to-end tests](/tests/)

Additionally, Github issues is a place to explain a problem in detail, along with a reproduction case for maintainers. However, Github issues is not the best place to ask how-to questions since project contributors and maintainers don’t have the capacity to debug external websites and the many third-party scripts. Any issues opened asking that are not following these guidelines will be closed.

## Is Partytown production ready?

Many sites are already successfully using Partytown in production. However, what's most important is testing your scripts first, as what works for one website using a certain third-party script, may not work for your site using a different script. If your scripts work in production that’s great, they shouldn't suddenly stop working (no different that a traditional third-party script).

However, if you're struggling with a certain scenario, please see the [Submitting Issues And Writing Tests](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/DEVELOPER.md#submitting-issues-and-writing-tests).
