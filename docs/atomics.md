Partytown will use [Atomics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics) when they're enabled by the browser. Some of the advantages include:

- 10x faster communication between threads compared to the service-worker requests
- 5% smaller build file compared to the service-worker build
- No `proxytown` requests in the network tab
- Less http requests to initialize the Partytown library
- Partytown service-worker and iframe is no longer used

It's important to note that [not all browsers support Atomics](#browser-atomics-support), and the server hosting the site must be configured with the correct response headers. If neither of those are true, then Partytown will fallback to using the service-worker communication layer instead.

## Document Response Headers

To enable Atomics communication, the browser's [crossOriginIsolated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/crossOriginIsolated) readonly property should be `true`. The `crossOriginIsolated` property is only set to true, by the browser, when the document includes these http response headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

- [Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) response header prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission. At the time of writing, "credentialless" is not a supported value in Safari, so Safari will fallback to using the Service Worker communication.
- [Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents.

## Setting Cross-Origin Attribute

An alternative to setting `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless`, is to instead use `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. The biggest thing to highlight is that the `require-corp` does not allow images, scripts, videos, etc. to be loaded from another origin. For example, when this header is set, any scripts or images to a CDN will no longer work.

However, the [crossorigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) attribute can be used on individual elements, such as `<audio>`, `<img>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<video>`, which allows these requests to go through and not be blocked.

Below is an example of setting the `crossorigin` attribute on an image:

```html
<img src="https://c.tenor.com/8wBCqZH60U8AAAAC/computer-cat.gif" crossorigin />
```
